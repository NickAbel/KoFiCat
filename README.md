# KoFiCat

This project aims to create a conjugation-first Anki deck for the Catalan language. For an introduction to the KOFI method, please refer to [the KOFI manual](https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.php) for Spanish, written by the method's creator.

This deck will initially focus on Central Catalan, leaving open the future possibility of generating decks presenting conjugations used in the Northwest, Balearic, and Valencian dialects.

The sentences in the deck are generated with ChatGPT 4o, but are verified against the conjugation tables found at [Verbs.cat](https://www.verbs.cat/). So, I can guarantee the correctness of the conjugations found in this deck, but at this early stage in my journey as a Catalan student, I cannot guarantee that the sentences are sensical.
