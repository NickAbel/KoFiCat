# KoFiCat

This project aims to create a conjugation-first Anki deck for the Catalan language. For an introduction to the KOFI method, please refer to [the KOFI manual](https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.php) for Spanish, written by the method's creator.

This deck will initially focus on Central Catalan, leaving open the future possibility of generating decks presenting conjugations used in the Northwest, Balearic, and Valencian dialects.

The sentences in the deck are generated with ChatGPT 4o, but are verified against the conjugation tables found at [Verbs.cat](https://www.verbs.cat/). So, I can guarantee the correctness of the conjugations found in this deck, but at this early stage in my journey as a Catalan student, I cannot guarantee that the sentences are sensical.

# Progress

- [x] Complete the below KOFI taxonomy of Catalan verbs, by describing the pattern and choosing a representative infinitive.
  - [x] Complete the taxonomy, excluding defective verbs and verbs with alternatives.
  - [x] Integrate defective verbs and/or verbs with alternatives if transformations in their conjugation tables are not described elsewhere.
- [ ] Choose and generate a complete sentence set for a common representative of each leaf-level tick mark of the KOFI taxonomy.
- [ ] In the "Similar" field, list other Catalan verbs with identical conjugation mappings to the representative.
- [ ] Order the verbs in the deck according to a frequency dictionary. Non-auxiliary verbs are shown first due to their importance. After that, the verb representing the conjugation mapping whose verbs cumulatively appear the most in the frequency dictionary should appear first.
- [ ] In the "Notes" field, state the type of conjugation (i.e, third-conjugation inchoative regular). Acknowledge any orthographic changes or defectiveness, and if needed, show the theoretical regular conjugation noting its incorrectness. Quantify the relative (ranked out of all verbs in deck) and total irregularity (the percentage of cards which show an irregularity) of the verb.
- [ ] Tag cards according to their subject, tense, and categories.
